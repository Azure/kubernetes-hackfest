## NGINX Plus Ingress Controller Workshop

<br/>

### Overview

<br/>

> ><strong>Welcome to the NGINX Plus Workshop for NGINX Ingress Controller (NIC)!</strong>

<br/>

This Workshop will introduce NGINX Plus Ingress Controller with hands-on practice through self-paced lab exercises.  You will learn how to deploy an **`NGINX Plus Ingress Controller`** on an Azure AKS cluster, configure basic and advanced NGINX Plus features, test it with demo applications, and monitor it in real time.

<br/>

The Hands-On Lab Exercises are designed to build upon each other, adding additional services and features as you progress through them.  `It is important to complete the lab exercises in sequential order.`

By the end of this Workshop, you will have a working, operational NGINX Plus Ingress Controller, with the skills to deploy and operate one for your Modern Application Kubernetes projects.

<br/>

### Prerequisites

- Students:  Personal Azure account that can provision AKS clusters.


### ** Prerequisite Knowledge **

It is `highly recommended` that Students attending this Workshop be familiar with NGINX and have some experience with Kubernetes administration, networking tools, and Load Balancing concepts.  Previous experience with VisualStudio Code is also helpful.
