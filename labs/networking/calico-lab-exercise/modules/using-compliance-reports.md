# Module 6: Using compliance reports

**Goal:** Use global reports to satisfy compliance requirementes.

## Steps

1. Use `Compliance Reports` view to see all generated reports.

    >We have deployed a few compliance reports in one of the first labs and by this time a few reports should have been already generated. 
    ```bash
    kubectl get globalreport                                                          
    NAME                     CREATED AT
    cluster-inventory        2021-06-10T03:24:07Z
    cluster-network-access   2021-06-10T03:24:07Z
    daily-cis-results        2021-06-10T03:24:05Z
    ```

    >If you don't see any reports, you can manually kick off report generation task. Follow the steps below if you need to do so.

    Calico provides `GlobalReport` resource to offer [Compliance reports](https://docs.tigera.io/compliance/compliance-reports/) capability. There are several types of reports that you can configure:

    - CIS benchmarks
    - Inventory
    - Network access
    - Policy audit


    A compliance report could be configured to include only specific endpoints leveraging endpoint labels and selectors. Each report has the `schedule` field that determines how often the report is going to be generated and sets the timeframe for the data to be included into the report.

    Compliance reports organize data in a CSV format which can be downloaded and moved to a long term data storage to meet compliance requirements.

2. *[Optional]* Manually kick off report generation task.

    It is possible to kick off report generation via a one off job.

    ```bash
    # get Calico version
    CALICO_VERSION=$(kubectl get clusterinformation default -ojsonpath='{.spec.cnxVersion}')
    # set report names
    CIS_REPORT_NAME='daily-cis-results'
    INVENTORY_REPORT_NAME='cluster-inventory'
    NETWORK_ACCESS_REPORT_NAME='cluster-network-access'
    
    # enable if you configured audit logs for EKS cluster and uncommented policy audit reporter job
    # you also need to add variable replacement in the sed command below
    # POLICY_AUDIT_REPORT_NAME='cluster-policy-audit'

    # get compliance reporter token
    COMPLIANCE_REPORTER_TOKEN=$(kubectl get secrets -n tigera-compliance | grep 'tigera-compliance-reporter-token*' | awk '{print $1;}')

    # replace variables in YAML and deploy reporter jobs
    sed -e "s?<COMPLIANCE_REPORTER_TOKEN>?$COMPLIANCE_REPORTER_TOKEN?g" \
      -e "s?<CALICO_VERSION>?$CALICO_VERSION?g" \
      -e "s?<CIS_REPORT_NAME>?$CIS_REPORT_NAME?g" \
      -e "s?<INVENTORY_REPORT_NAME>?$INVENTORY_REPORT_NAME?g" \
      -e "s?<NETWORK_ACCESS_REPORT_NAME>?$NETWORK_ACCESS_REPORT_NAME?g" \
      -e "s?<REPORT_START_TIME_UTC>?$(date -u -d '1 hour ago' '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')?g" \
      -e "s?<REPORT_END_TIME_UTC>?$(date -u +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')?g" \
      demo/40-compliance-reports/cluster-reporter-jobs.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
    ```

    ```bash
    #create three batch jobs for different compliance reports. 
    job.batch/run-cluster-reporter-network-access created
    job.batch/run-cluster-reporter-inventory created
    job.batch/run-cluster-reporter-cis created

    
    ```
