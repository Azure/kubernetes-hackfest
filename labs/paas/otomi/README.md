# Otomi: Self-hosted PaaS for AKS

[Otomi](https://otomi.io/) is an open source self-hosted PaaS for Kubernetes and connects many of the technologies found in the CNCF landscape in a single installable package to provide direct value to developers. Otomi:

- Brings a full PaaS to your own Kubernetes cluster with a GitOps way of working (where disired state is reflected as code and automatically synchronised to the cluster), an advanced ingress architecture, policy management, multi-tenancy and developer self-service. The only thing you'll need to do is deploy your application and Otomi will do the rest.

- Allows you to turn any Kubernetes cluster into a full platform without the constraints and abstractions of traditional PaaS offerings like OpenShift, Cloud Foundry and Heroku.

- Removes the burden of building and maintaining your internal platform, lowers the burden on operations, and empowers developers to focus on application deployment and management only.

## About the workshop

The workshop walks you through the all the steps required to install and use Otomi on AKS.

##  For who is the workshop?

- Developers
- Solutions Architects
- DevOps Engineers
- SREs
- Infrastructure & Cloud Engineers

## Learning objectives

The main objective is to get a good understanding/overview of Otomi and be able to identify the benefits and possible use cases for it.

## Lab prerequisites

- Azure account and Azure cloud shell access

In case of not using Azure Cloud shell, install

- [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [az cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- Optionally: [K9s](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

## Labs

The workshop is organized into 5 labs (plus one bonus):

- Lab 1: [Create an AKS cluster](1_create_aks_cluster/README.md)
- Lab 2: [Installing Otomi on AKS](2_install_otomi/README.md)
- Lab 3: [Using Teams in Otomi](3_create_team/README.md)
- Lab 4: [Configuring network policies in Otomi](4_netpols/README.md)
- Lab 5: [Activate apps in Otomi](5_activate_apps/README.md)
- Lab 6: [Using Knative in Otomi](6_knative/README.md)

After completing the labs, you'll be able to:

- Install Otomi on AKS with basic configuration options
- Use the Teams feature in Otomi for multi-tenancy and network isolation
- Use te Otomi web UI to expose K8s services and configure network policies between workloads
- Explain the difference between Otomi core apps and how to activate optional apps
- Create Knative workloads using the Otomi web UI
